AnimationXBlock
===============

Animation. Images with text and a slider. Sliding the slider changes
images+text.

Next steps: 

* Discoverability is poor. The tool should either have instructions
  the first time it pops up, fade-in/fade-out text explaining slider,
  or at the very least, a tooltip. 
* The slider knob should turn green when done. 
* There should be an option for no text (if text is e.g. in the image)
* Nicer styling
* Grading/progress
